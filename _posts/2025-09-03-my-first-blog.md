Hello, my name is Evan Cazalas.

My major is Biomedical Engineering, though I am considering dual-majoring in Biochemistry as well.

I am expected to graduate in May 2029

My goal in my life is to get my doctorate in Biomedical Engineering and further medical research, particularly in cancer research and artificial organs.

A few of my hobbies are playing the piano, reading, and baking!

My favorite subject in college has been my engineering classes.
