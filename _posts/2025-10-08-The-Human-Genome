Are you defined by your genome?

My answer to this question is yes and no. 

The human genome is, in a way, information and coding that we are born with.

We can now, through technology, test our genome to determine health risks and genetic factors.

The way I personally think about this is that not every person has the same risk of cancer. 

I am personally at a higher risk of cancer because my grandfather had it.

Whereas someone who does not have a close relative does not have a higher risk.

My genome contains that information.

The human genome creates information about everything.

Physical traits like eyes and hair,  and personality traits. 

Even health and physical abilities are all things the human genome created.

Despite all this, the genome can’t compete with the environment you live in.

Your genome was created before you were born, and it had no idea what life you were going to live.

Your environment can influence how your genes express themselves.

Childhood stress, diet, and exposure to toxins are all environmental factors that change how your gene is expressed.

These all fall under something called epigenetics.

In one of my other courses (PUBH 2181), we discuss quite frequently how the environment affects your health. 

ACES (Adverse Childhood Experiences) are an example of how the environment affects genetics.

People who have 4 or more ACES are two times more at risk for stroke, cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.

Our genome defines us before we are born, and our environment can change what our genome defines.
