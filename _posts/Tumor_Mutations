Genome sequencing has revealed a large amount about human cancers.

In this blog post, I will focus on what it revealed about tumors.

Genome sequencing has allowed us to learn more about mutations in tumors and cancer.

For example, lung tumors and melanomas contain 200 non-synonymous mutations per tumor.

Non-synonymous mutations are mutations that alter the encoded amino acid sequence of a protein. 

Many mutations fall under non-synonymous mutations, like nonsense and missense mutations.

One thing that we do know about tumors is that age does affect tumor mutations.

Pedicatic tumors, on average, have a 9.6 mutation rate per tumor.

When it comes to adults, these numbers get much larger.

To name a few, there are 135 gene mutations in malomana, 35 in glioblastoma, and 57 in esophageal adenocarcinoma.

This is quite a distinct difference from pediatric tumors.


So why do adults have such larger gene mutations?
